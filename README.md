# MonsterHunterDamageCalculator
An app used to calculate the damage a weapon will do to a particular monster body parts.

Damage may vary depending on rank and online.

The purpose of this app is to compare weapons in each class to determine which weapon is best for which monster.
It should not be used to compare weapons of different class as each weapon has different attack speeds and uses.
